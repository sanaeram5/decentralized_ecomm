##### _- A Decentralized cart_


DecentraCart is a decentralized ecommerce built using blockchain. By implementing e-commerce using blockchain decentralises the blockchain thereby eliminating the middle agents and directly making a connection between the buyer and the seller. This establishes trust between the parties and further makes the whole system transparent. Directly connecting the buyer and the seller fasten ups the process and even increases the profit margin as the money that used to go to the middle agents gets saved.

## Implementation

DecentraCart is implemented using the blockchain. All the data will be stored on the blockchain itself. The whole system is divided into 3 modules:-
### 1. Seller
- Sellers would first have to register to the platform.
- After registering the seller will get a dashboard where the seller can check all details.
- For listing the products- the seller will have to fill  a (general) form regarding the product like the name, description, features, image and the price of the product.
- Whenever there is an order the seller would get a notification regarding the orders, and could check all the orders and track them from the Orders section.
- On a successful delivery the particular item delivered will reflect the status and will be shifted to the delivered products section.
- In case of a query or feedback, the seller will have to answer them.

### 2.Buyer
- Buyer will get all the features provided as in a normal ecommerce site, except for that everything is on blockchain.

### 3.Delivery guy
- It is managed from the seller's end.

## How the Smart contract Plays here?
> All the data would be stored on the blockchain. Most of it would be visible to the users except for confidential ones, like user credentials and account details. As soon as the buyer places an order, the amount that needs to be paid would be deducted from his account and would be locked by the smart contract. As soon as the product gets successfully delivered this amount would be transferred to the sellers account. This would make the system transparent and more trustworthy. Thus, eliminating any chances of fraudulence.


## Tech Stack

DecentraCart uses a number of technologies to work properly:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. 
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - evented I/O for the backend
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - It is an object-oriented, high-level language used for implementing smart contracts which facilitates transaction and storing products. It can be used for crowdfunding, voting, auctions etc.
- [Web3JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/#) - It is a collection of libraries that allows to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket. It allows us to make requests to an individual Ethereum node with JSON RPC in order to read and write data to the network. 

- [Ganache, Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) - Ganache is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum and Corda distributed application development. While truffle is a development environment for blockchain dapps (decentralized applications) and smart contracts.


- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - MetaMask is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or “Dapps” in a browser! The extension injects the Ethereum web3 API into every website's javascript context, so that DApps can read from the blockchain.
